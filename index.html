          JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, 
          in the behavior of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic
          styling; with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers 
          your understanding of what is possible.

        <header>What is JavaScript</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that can add interactivity
          to a website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.  
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience, you'll be able to create games,
           animated 2D and 3D graphics, comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools
           on top of the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality 
            such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream 
            from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
          </li>
          <li>
            Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers,
            such as Twitter or Facebook
          </li>
          <li>
            Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites
            and applications.
          </li>
        </ul>

          JavaScript is arguably more difficult to learn than related technologies such as HTML and CSS. Before attempting
          to learn JavaScript, you are strongly advised to get familiar with at least these two technologies first, and perhaps
          others as well. Start by working through the following modules:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Getting started with the Web</li>
          <li>Introduction to HTML</li>
          <li>Introduction to CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Having previous experience with other programming languages might also help.</p>
        <p>
          After getting familiar with the basics of JavaScript, you should be in a position to learn about more advanced 
          topics, for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript in depth</li>
          <li>Web APIs</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="hello_world_example" class="main-section">
        <header>Hello World Example</header>
        <p>
          JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites
           will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and 
          CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript 
          to your page for creating a Hello world! example. 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the <span class="span_default">scripts</span> folder, 
            create a new file called main.js, and save it.
          </li>
          <li>
            In your <span class="span_default">index.html</span> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing 
            <span class="span_default">body</span> tag:
            <code>
              <span class="span_code"><</span>script src="scripts/main.js"<span class="span_code">></span><span class="span_code"><</span>/script<span class="span_code">></span>
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            This is doing the same job as the <span class="span_default">link</span> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on 
            the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
          </li>
          <li>
            Add this code to the <span class="span_default">main.js</span> file:
            <code>
              const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');<br>
              myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';
            </code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load index.html in your browser. You should see something like this:
            <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics/hello-world.png" alt="hello world example output">
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          To give you a better understanding of how JavaScript works, let's explain some of the core features of the language.
          It's worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages.
        </p>
        <div class="course_variables">
          <h3>Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the var (less recommended,
            dive deeper for the explanation) or the let keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable:
          </p>
          <code>
            let myVariable;
          </code>
          <p>
            After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:
          </p>
          <code>
            myVariable = 'Bob';
          </code>
          <p>
            Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:
          </p>
          <code>
            let myVariable = 'Bob';
          </code>
          <p>
            You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:
          </p>
          <code>
            myVariable;
          </code>
          <p>
            After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:
          </p>
          <code>
            let myVariable = 'Bob'; <br>
            myVariable = 'Steve';
          </code>
          <p>Note that variables may hold values that have different data types</p>
        </div>
        <div class="course_comments">
          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>
            Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The 
            browser ignores text marked as comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:
          </p>
          <code>
            /* <br>
            &nbsp; Everything in between is a comment.<br>
            */ 
          </code>
          <p>
            If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:
          </p>
          <code>
            // This is a comment
          </code>
        </div>
        <div class="course_operators">
          <h3>Operators</h3>
          <p>
            An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).
            See  for a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators" target="_blank">Expressions and operators</a>
            complete list along with some examples.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coarse_conditionals">
          <h3>Conditionals</h3>
          <p>
            Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of conditionals is the <span class="span_default">if ... else</span> 
            statement. For example:
          </p>
          <code>
            let iceCream = 'chocolate';<br>
            if(iceCream === 'chocolate') { <br>
            &nbsp; alert('Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!');<br>
            } else {<br>
            &nbsp; alert('Awwww, but chocolate is my favorite...');<br>
            }
          </code>
          <p>
            The expression inside the <span class="span_default">if( ... )</span> is the test. This uses the identity operator (as described above) to compare the variable <span class="span_default">iceCream</span> with the string 
            <span class="span_default">chocolate</span> to see if the two are equal. If this comparison returns true, the first block of code runs. If the comparison is not true, the second block of 
            code—after the <span class="span_default">else</span> statement—runs instead.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course_functions">
          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a function that 
            executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. In this <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Function/" target="_blank" > link</a>,
            you can learn more about this topic.
          </p>

        </div>
        <div class="course_events">
          <h3>Events</h3>
          <p>
            Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most 
            obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following 
            into your console, then click on the current webpage:
          </p>
          <code>
            document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() { <br>
            &nbsp; alert('Ouch! Stop poking me!'); <br> 
            } 
          </code>
          <p>
            There are many ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <span class="span_default">html</span> element, setting its <span class="span_default">onclick</span> handler property equal to an anonymous
            (i.e. nameless) function, which contains the code we want the click event to run.
          </p>
          <p>Note that</p>
          <code>
            document.querySelector('html').onclick = function() {};
          </code>
          <p>is equivalent to</p>
          <code>
            let myHTML = document.querySelector('html');<br>
            myHTML.onclick = function() {};
          </code>
          <p>It's just shorter.</p>
